### Building systems that scale. Designing experiences that matter.

Welcome to my digital space.

This portfolio is where I document what I build, how I think, and the systems I design. I’m an Information Systems student at Singapore Management University who enjoys turning complex problems into structured, production-ready solutions.

## What I Care About

I’m drawn to work at the intersection of:

- ⚙️ Scalable backend systems
- 🧩 Microservices & enterprise architecture
- ☁️ Cloud deployment & DevOps practices
- 📊 Data-driven digital transformation
- 🎨 Clean, intentional UI/UX

I don’t just like writing code — I like designing how systems connect, communicate, and evolve.

## How I Build

This portfolio reflects how I approach projects:

- Modular folder structure
- Data-driven rendering (JSON-powered content)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Lightweight, performant frontend
- Deployed using GitHub Pages

I believe in building things properly — even when they’re small.
